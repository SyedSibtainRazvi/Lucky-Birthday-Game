# Lucky-Birthday-Game

## Description:
**Lucky Birthday** is an amazing game that we can play with our friends. It takes our **Date of Birth** and **Lucky Number** and tells us if our birthdates are lucky or not. It's just a game!

### Technologies Used:
1) HTML.
2) CSS.
3) Vanilla JavaScript.
***
**Brief:** In this application, I have took data from input boxes and using **querySelectors** I have stored them in variables. **To handle errors**, I have used input type as **date** and **number**. I have used a **Button** and added event listeners
on **click** function. And computation is done simply by adding numbers in the date of Birth and dividing it by lucky Number.

#### What Next?
To make the next inputs available only when the user fills the first input field.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
